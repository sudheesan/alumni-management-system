          Heat oil in a (14- to 16-inch) paella pan or a large, deep skillet
          over medium-high heat. Add chicken, shrimp and chorizo, and cook,
          stirring occasionally until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer
          shrimp to a large plate and set aside, leaving chicken and chorizo in
          the pan. Add piment√≥n, bay leaves, garlic, tomatoes, onion, salt and
          pepper, and cook, stirring often until thickened and fragrant, about
          10 minutes. Add saffron broth and remaining 4 1/2 cups chicken broth;
          bring to a boil.
